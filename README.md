# Convolutional Neural Networks on CIFAR10

CIFAR10 dataset is analysed with PyTorch. Implemented LeNet model. This task is a multi-class classification problem.
The dataset is splitted into training and test dataset and it is normalised.Data is preprocessed and data augmentation 
is applied. The LeNet model is implemented from scratch and trained. At the end of this process, 75% acurracy is obtained 
on the test dataset and corresponding plots are shown.
